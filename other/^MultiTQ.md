# MultiTQ

**MultiTQ** [[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a new complex temporal question answering dataset with multi-granularity temporal information. Compared to existing datasets, our dataset features in a few advantages, including
large scale, ample relations and multiple temporal granularity, which hence better reflects real-world scenarios. we take ICEWS05-15 (García-Durán et al., 2018), a subset from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) database, as the KG for MULTITQ. ICEWS captures and processes millions of pieces of data from digital news media, social media and other sources, with a wealth of dynamic semantic information that provides an adequate KG for temporal question answering. ICEWS05-15 is rich in semantic information with SC value 7.05. The richness of relation types makes it more in line with real-life scenarios.
