# Math23K (Math23K for Math Word Problem Solving)

**DBLP-QuAD** [[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a dataset created for math word problem solving, contains 23, 162 Chinese problems crawled from the Internet. Refer to our paper for more details: The dataset is originally introduced in the paper Deep Neural Solver for Math Word Problems. The original files are originally split into train/test split, while other research efforts (https://github.com/2003pro/Graph2Tree) perform the train/dev/test split.
